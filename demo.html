          <p class="lead">
            As you can likely tell, the video is a bit choppy. This is due to the fact that the javascript running the interface is constantly converting between beats and time points within the song- rounding and some errors (for example, in the
            number of beats per minute, which may not be a perfectly exact number) can lead to some small but noticeable errors in jumps between similar beats.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            For this reason, we've included a separate audio demo. You won't have the benefit of watching at which points the song jumps, but you will be able to enjoy much smoother audio as we've eliminated rounding errors.

    <h3 class="demo-header text-center">UI Comparison</h3>
    <p class="lead">
      As can be seen below, our user interfaces are similar. One thing worth noting is that our products resulted in slightly different jump points: our version contained some pairs that are not found in the original. This is due to our tolerance
      threshold for measuring similarity: ours tolerance is likely a little less strict, resulting in more pairs of beats qualifying as "similar enough" to include.

            as to illustrate when jumps occur.</p>
